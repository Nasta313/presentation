When someone says the word “scrum,” you might think they are talking about people playing rugby. But, when someone use this word in the workplace, they probably mean Scrum with a capital “S”, which begs the question: what is Scrum?  

Scrum is a widely-used, agile product development strategy - a collection of values, team roles, and rituals used in combination to create iterative work products. Scrum began in the software industry and then spread to other spheres.  

Scrum is not an acronym. Scrum sounds like something from the sport like rugby. In fact, that is exactly where the name comes from.
The term “scrum” was first introduced by professors Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka in 1986 in their Harvard Business Review article. They described a “rugby”- style approach to product development.
In the following years, software developers Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland each implemented these development strategies at their own companies, and in 1995 they came together to present and define their version of Scrum - a development strategy that evolved into the Scrum framework used today.
Scrum definition included term the “agile.” And, you might also have heard about something called agile methodology. But Scrum and agile methodology are not two ways of describing the same thing.
In the 1990’s there was a general movement away from heavily planned and regimented development methods in the software industry. More flexible methods and frameworks (like Scrum) began to be adopted by software developers. And in 2001 a group of 17 developers created a document called the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.
We can say that Agile methodology is an umbrella term. Scrum and other  directions, like Extreme programming, Kanban are hanging out underneath that agile umbrella. In fact Scrum is the most popular agile methodology, 70% of software teams use Scrum.  

There are 4 important values of Agile manifesto:  
*Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools  
*Working Software over comprehensive documentation  
*Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation  
*Responding to Change over following a plan  
The items on the left are valued more than the items on the right.  

The below graphic represents Scrum in action. Scrum replaces a programmed algorithmic approach with a heuristic one, with respect for people and self-organization to deal with unpredictability and solving complex problems.  The Scrum framework is made up of three categories: roles, events, and artifacts.  

We can say that there are some principles of Scrum. They are Iterative development, Time-boxing, Value-based prioritization, Collaboration, Self-organization, Empirical process control.  

The Scrum framework is defined by three **main roles**: the Development Team, the Scrum Master, and the Product Owner.  
The first role is **The Product Owner**. This individual is like a project lead or producer, and his aim is to maximize the value of the product. by ensuring the Development Team produces the best possible work. The Product Owner largely focuses on maintaining the Product Backlog
The Development Team is  the group of developers that actually produce the work defined in the Product Backlog. The development team should be self-organizing and fully independent from the Scrum Master. 
The Scrum Master is the team’s facilitator. He helps all team members follow Scrums rules, and practices. He make sure the Scrum Team has whatever it needs to complete its work.

The scrum framework defines five types of events. These are the Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.
A Sprint is a specified time period during which a Scrum team produces a product. Sprint usually ranging from one week to one month long. When one Sprint ends, the next immediately begins.
Sprint Planning  is a meeting where the work to be done during a Sprint is defined. During this meeting, the  team clearly defines results for the Sprint and assigns the work necessary to achieve that goal.
The Daily Scrum sometimes called a Stand-Up or Daily. Every day, the Development Team meets for a maximum of 15 minutes to discuss the planned work for the next day. 
The Sprint Review takes place after a Sprint ends. This is event with a maximum duration of four hours. During Review, the Product Owner explains what planned work either was or was not completed during the Sprint. The team then presents completed work and talks through what went well and how problems were solved.
The Sprint Retrospective also takes place after a Sprint. Retrospective provide a dedicated forum for the team to analyze their process during the previous Sprint and make adaptations as needed. 

The next category of scrum is Artifacts. Artifacts are just physical records that provide project details. Scrum Artifacts include the Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Product Increments.
The Product Backlog 	is an ordered list of all product requirements. The Product Backlog is maintained by the Product Owner.
The Sprint Backlog  is a subset of items from the Product Backlog that have been selected to be part of a Sprint. 
A Product Increment is the sum of product work completed during a Sprint, combined with all work completed during previous Sprints. 

In Scrum there is such a thing as story points.
Story points are a unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort that will be required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work.
When we estimate items with story points, we assign a point value to each item. The raw values we assign are unimportant. What matters are the relative values. A story that is assigned as 2 should be twice as much as a story that is assigned as 1.
